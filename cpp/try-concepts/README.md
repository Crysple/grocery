# Try concepts in C++ 20

* Need to update your complier since C++ 20 is kind of new. Alternatively you can use [wandbox](https://wandbox.org/).

* This code tries to “conceptualize” (i.e., define the template arguments using concepts) the following algorithms:
  * find()
  * find_if()
  * sort()
* for (first,last) iterator arguments and for a (range) argument.
* Refer to [\<concepts\>](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/concepts).
